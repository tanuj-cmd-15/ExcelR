Java Introduction
- Java is a popular programming language introduced in 1995.
- It is owned by Oracle
- more than 3 billion devices run java.


It is used for
1)Mobile development(specially with android)
2)Desktop applications
3)web Applications
4)web servers and application servers
5)Games
6)Database connectivity



Why use JAVA?
- Java works on different platforms like windows,linux,Mac etc
- It is most used language
- It is having huge demand over job market
- It is easy to learn
- It is open source and free
- It has huge community support
- Java is a Object oriented language which gives clear structure of code
- If you are familiar with c++ or c# then you can switch and vice versa.


Rules for writing java code
- class should start with uppercase letter
- Java is case-sensitive
- java file name should match with class name
- main method is must and compiler will start compiling from main()
- System.out.println used to print text 


Java Syntax 
public class Main{
public static void main(){
System.out.ptintln("Welcome to Java!")
System.out.ptintln("Welcome to Javascript!")

System.Out.print("Welcome to Java!")
System.Out.print("Welcome to Java!")
}
}

compiling - javac Main.java

Println() - will print the statement in new line
print() - will print in the same line

Java Comments
// - single comment
/* */ - multiline comment

Java Variables
- Variables are containers for storing data
- In Java, there are different types of variables

Creating variable syntax - type variableName = value;

Variable Types
1)String - stores text ("")
2)int - stores integers (whole numbers without decimals)
3)float - stores floating point numbers
4)char - stores single character like 'a' or 'A'
5)Boolean - stores true or false

The general rules naming variables 
- All java variables should be uniquely identified
example - int minutesPerHour = 60; m = 60;
	  name - "John" , n = "John"
- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores and dollars.
- Name should begin with a letter
- Name can start with a lowercase letter and cannot contain whitespace
- Names can also start with $ and _
- Names are case-sensitive for example myvar and myVar are different
- Reserved words cannot be used such as int and Boolean


Java Data Types 
In Java, there are 2 types 
1)Primitive Data types - They specify size and value  and it has no additional methods
Data type     Size      Description 
- byte        1 byte    stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
- short	      2 bytes   
- int         4 bytes
- long        8 bytes
- float       4 bytes
- double      8 bytes
- Boolean     1 bit
- char        2 bytes

1)Numbers  - Integers and floats
* Integers can hold data types such as int,byte,short and long
* Float can hold types such as float and double
2)Boolean Data type
3)Character Data type


2)non-primitive data types
- Strings - They are used to store text example - "John"

- arrays - 
- classes -

Java Type Casting 
- It is when you assign value of one primitive data type to another 

Types of Casting
1)Widening casting / Automatic Type casting
- Converting smaller type to larger  (done by compiler)
byte -> short ->char->int->long->double

2)Narrowing Casting/ Manual Type casting
- Converting large type to smaller ( done by programmer )
double->long->int->char->short->byte


Java Operators
- Operators are used to perform some operation on variables and values

Types of Operators
1)Arithmetic Operator - used to perform mathematical operations
  Operator       Name     	Description 
1) +  		Addition	Adds 2 values
2) - 		Substraction	subtracts 
3)*		Multiplication	multiplies
4)/		Division	Divides
5)%		Modulus		returns reminder after a%b
6)++/--		Increment/
		decrement
2)Assignment - Used to assign a value 
Operator 	Example 	Same as 
1)=		x = 5		x= 5
2)+=		x+=3		x=x+3
3)-=		x-=3		x=x-3
4)*=		x*=3		x=x*3
5)/=		x/=3		x=x/3
6)%= 		x%=3		x=x%3
7)&=		x&=3		x=x&3
8)|=		x|=3		x=x|3
9)^=		x^=3		x=x^3
10)>>=		x>>=3		x=x>>3
11)<<=		x<<=3		x=x<<3
	
3)Comparison
4)Logical
5)Bitwise
