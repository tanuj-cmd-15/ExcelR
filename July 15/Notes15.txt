Basic structure of software development 
1) Frontend

- everything that you see on the website

2) Backend
- engine of a car can be backend
- Its business logic written using - java,

3) Database
- fuel of the car can be data
- It is a place to store data


SQL 
- Structured Query Language
- It is not a Database Management System 
- It is used to perform some operations such as create,Read,Update 
on the records which are stored already in the database
- If you want to perform some operation on the database DBMS 
- Example Oracle,mySql,mongodb

History of SQL
- A paper published by great scientist E.F Codd in 1970 about "A relational Model of Data for large shared Data Banks"
- IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin originally developed  SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language)
- at the end of 1970s relational software inc developed first SQL using concepts of all 3 scientists 
- SQL was totally based on RDBMS
- In 1979, Relational software inc was known as oracle corporation which was first implementation of SQL language

why SQL?
- it is used to perform CRUD operations
- It helps to describe data
- allo you to restrict or set the permission to access the data
- modify the data

Process of SQL

Types of Database
1)Non-Relational
- In a non-relational database, data is stored in key-value pairs
example - { 
		"id":101,
		"name": "John",
		"age":25
	  }
- commonly used non-relational database management system such as MongoDB,Amazon DynamoDB,Redis etc


2)Relational(RDBMS)
- In RDBMS, data will be stored in tabular format

for example 

student_id   student_Name  student_age  student_city
1001	     Ramesh 	     19		Bengaluru
1002	     Suresh 	     21		Mysore	


- commonly used RDBMS like MYSQL,Oracle,PostgreSQL

SQL Statements
- They are used to perform some task 
- They consist of some keywords that are easy to understand
- SQL keywords are not case sensitive 

1)SELECT 
- It is the command used to select the records based on the condition

Selecting all records 
SELECT * from student;


student_id     student_name     student_age
101             Ram 		15		//record
102		sham		20

syntax - select col1,col2,... 
		from table_name

SQL select distinct statement
- It returns distinct values in a column 

SQL orderby 
- This is used to sort the result in ascending or descending order

syntax - select * from table_name
		order by name asc/desc

SQL where clause
- The where clause in select is used to filter records
- It is used to extract those records that fulfill a specified condition




2)SQL Insert into statement
- This statement is used to insert the records to the table

- specify both column name and values to be inserted 

syntax - INSERT INTO table_name (col1,col2,col3....) 
		values (value1,value2,value3....)

- if you want to add values to all columns then no need to mention column names

syntax - INSERT INTO table_name
		values(val1,val2,val3)










Some of the most important SQL commands
1) SELECT - extract the data from a database
2) Insert - used the data into the table
